* Magnetic Needle Stuff
** Python/Arduino Controller
   It's in the =controller= folder.
   To run it, you'll need to install =pygame= and use Python 3.

   Just call:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   python controller.py
   #+END_SRC

   The Arduino should still be running the software, but you can compile
   the =.ino= file if you need to reupload it
